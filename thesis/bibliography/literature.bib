        interest point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up

        previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability,
        distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much
        faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image
        convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing
        detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based
        measure for the detector, and a distribution-based
        descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the
        essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection,

        results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery

        expanding field of computer vision. Written by the creators of OpenCV,
        the widely used free open- source library, this book introduces you to
        computer vision and demonstrates how you can quickly build
        applications that enable computers to "see" and make decisions
        based on the data. Computer vision is everywhere - in security
        systems, manufacturing inspection systems, medical image analysis,
        Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and more. It helps robot cars drive by
        themselves, stitches Google maps and Google Earth together, checks
        the pixels on your laptop's LCD screen, and makes sure the stitches
        in your shirt are OK. OpenCV provides an easy-to-use computer
        vision infrastructure along with a comprehensive library containing
        more than 500 functions that can run vision code in real time. With
        Learning OpenCV, any developer or hobbyist can get up and running
        with the framework quickly, whether it's to build simple or
        sophisticated vision applications. The book includes: A thorough
        introduction to OpenCV Getting input from cameras Transforming
        images Shape matching Pattern recognition, including face detection
        Segmenting images Tracking and motion in 2 and 3 dimensions Machine
        learning algorithms Hands-on exercises at the end of each chapter
        help you absorb the concepts, and an appendix explains how to set
        up an OpenCV project in Visual Studio. OpenCV is written in
        performance optimized C/C++ code, runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac
        OS X, and is free for commercial and research use under a BSD
        license. Getting machines to see is a challenging but entertaining

        This paper concerns the problem of fully automated panoramic image
        stitching. Though the 1D problem (single axis of rotation) is well
        studied, 2D or multi-row stitching is more dif cult. Previous
        approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image
        sequence in order to establish matching images. In this work, we
        formulate stitching as a multi-image matching problem, and use
        invariant local fea- tures to nd matches between all of the images.
        Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering,
        orientation, scale and illumination of the input images. It is also
        insen- sitive to noise images that are not part of a panorama, and
        can recognise multiple panoramas in an unordered image dataset. In
        addition to providing more detail, this paper ex- tends our
        previous work in the area BL03 by introducing gain compensation and
        automatic straightening steps.},

@article{Slaney2008,
    abstract={This lecture note describes a technique known as
        locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) that allows one to quickly find
        similar entries in large databases. This approach belongs to a
        novel and interesting class of algorithms that are known as
        randomized algorithms. A randomized algorithm does not guarantee an
        exact answer but instead provides a high probability guarantee that
        it will return the correct answer or one close to it. By investing
        additional computational effort, the probability can be pushed as
        high as desired.},

        modern applications, such as protein function classification, music

        introduces the task of multi-label classification, organizes the

    abstract = {In this survey, we give an overview of invariant interest point
        detectors, how they evolved over time, how they work, and what their
        respective strengths and weaknesses are. We begin with defining the
        properties of the ideal local feature detector. This is followed by
        an overview of the literature over the past four decades organized
        in different categories of feature extraction methods. We then
        provide a more detailed analysis of a selection of methods which
        had a particularly significant impact on the research field. We
        conclude with a summary and promising future research directions.},
