@article{Lowe1999,
abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

@misc{Bay2006,
abstract = {. In this paper, we present a novel scale- and rotation-invariant interest point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features). It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both show SURFs strong performance. 1},

abstract = {We propose to use binary strings as an efficient feature point descriptor, which we call BRIEF.We show that it is highly discriminative even when using relatively few bits and can be computed using simple intensity difference tests. Furthermore, the descriptor similarity can be evaluated using the Hamming distance, which is very efficient to com- pute, instead of the L2 norm as is usually done. As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match.We compare it against SURF and U-SURF on standard benchmarks and show that it yields a similar or better recognition performance, while running in a fraction of the time required by either.},

We then provide a more detailed analysis of a selection of methods which had a particularly significant impact on the research field. We conclude with a summary and promising future research directions.},

While significant progress has been made in robotic grasping of objects and geometric path planning for manipulation, such work treats the world and the object being grasped as immovable, often declaring failure when simple motions of the object could produce success. We analyze the mechanics of push-grasping and present a quasi-static tool that can be used both for analysis and simulation.We utilize this analysis to derive a fast, feasible motion planning algorithm that produces stable push- grasp plans for dexterous hands in the presence of object pose uncertainty and high clutter. We demonstrate our algorithm extensively in simulation and on HERB, a personal robotics platform developed at Intel Labs Pittsburgh.},

@article{Brown2006,
abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of fully automated panoramic image stitching. Though the 1D problem (single axis of rotation) is well studied, 2D or multi-row stitching is more dif cult. Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence in order to establish matching images. In this work, we formulate stitching as a multi-image matching problem, and use invariant local fea- tures to nd matches between all of the images. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the input images. It is also insen- sitive to noise images that are not part of a panorama, and can recognise multiple panoramas in an unordered image dataset. In addition to providing more detail, this paper ex- tends our previous work in the area BL03 by introducing gain compensation and automatic straightening steps.},

Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7\% of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120\%) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300\%) can operate at full frame rate.},
