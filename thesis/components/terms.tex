\begin{description}
    \item[template object] a real-world object we want to be able to recognize
    \item[model] a set of features that describes a template object
    \item[model view] a 2d image and a point cloud that show a template object from a certain camera viewpoint
    \item[model image] the 2d image belonging to a model view
    \item[model cloud] a point cloud belonging to a model view 
    \item[model keypoint] a 2d keypoint belonging to a model image 
    \item[model feature] a 2d keypoint, a corresponding 3d point in model frame, and a descriptor vector
    \item[model frame] a coordinate system attached to the template object 
    \item[model coordinates] coordinates relative to the model frame 
    \item[camera frame] a coordinate system attached to the camera 
    \item[camera coordinates] coordinates relative to the camera frame 
    \item[camera origin] origin of camera frame 
    \item[template pose] Defines the transformation of model coordinates into
        camera coordinates in a given model view. 
    \item[estimated pose] Estimate for an object's pose in the query image. The
        translation vector of the estimated pose is equal to the template origin
        relative to the camera frame.
    \item[query image] a test image on which objects are to be recognized 
    \item[query cloud] a test image on which objects are to be recognized 
    \item[query keypoint] a 2d keypoint in the query image
    \item[query feature] a 2d keypoint, a corresponding 3d point in camera frame and a descriptor vector
