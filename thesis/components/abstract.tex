Recognition of textured objects is fundamental to many robotic applications in
household environments. This thesis addresses the perception task of robustly
recognizing textured objects in a cluttered scene, focusing on laying the
foundation for resolving the cluttered scene by successively removing objects.

A system is presented that learns 3d models and local 2d features from template
objects and is then able to recognize objects in cluttered scenes by combining
the matching of 2d features with a pose-estimation algorithm. The system
selects the best estimate based on confidence probability. It makes use of an
existing textured object recognition stack in the Robot Operating System.

Experiments have shown that in XX percent an object is correctly located in 
a cluttered scene.
