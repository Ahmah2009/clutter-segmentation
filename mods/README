The files in this directories are all files that have been adapted to our
needs, or were being patched. The following lists the SVN revisions from which
the adaptations have been derived.

stack                           package             revision
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
object_recognition              tod_detecting       50974
object_recognition              tod_training        50974

All modified files can be hardlinked using the script mods-link, thus after
linking, changes to patches in this repository will be automatically reflected
in their respective source repo (and the other way round). A list of patches
in place can be retrieved by issuing 'svn status object_recognition' and a list
of ready patches should be maintained in mods.txt

Adding a new patch
------------------
1. Create new patch
2. Update mods.txt
3. Remove file to patch
4. Call mods-link

Integrating OpenCV from trunk into ROS
--------------------------------------

OpenCV 1044 was blocking the usage of SiftFeatureDetector. Therefore, the
latest OpenCV version (svn rev 5024) containing the bug fix has been backported
and integrated into the diamondback release version. Several smaller changes
had to be made to make this possible. Here is a rough guide of what was done
for switching from OpenCV 2.2. Basically, switching from
https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/browser/branches/2.2/) to
https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/browser/trunk

See also http://answers.ros.org/question/867/how-to-use-very-latest-opencv-version-in-ros

1. Change <diamondback>/stacks/vision_opencv/opencv2/Makefile
    - adapt SVN_URL, set to "https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/trunk"
    - adapt SVN_REVISION, set to "-r5024"
    - disable this patch "# SVN_PATCH = pythontest.patch"
    - FIXME change directories properly
2. Change permissions of <diamondback>/stacks/vision_opencv/opencv2>
    - either by chown or chmod
3. Change permissions of <diamondback>/stacks/vision_opencv/cv_bridge>
    - either by chown or chmod
4. Remove ROS_NOBUILD files
    - in cv_bridge and opencv2
5. Remake ROS packages opencv2 and cv_bridge
    - watch out for errors
6. Fix issues with missing includes

This recipe might not be complete, since haven't traced every single
step. But roughly, it finally worked.
