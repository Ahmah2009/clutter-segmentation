All modified files can be hardlinked using the script mods-link, thus after
linking, changes to patches in this repository will be automatically reflected
in their respective source repo (and the other way round). A list of patches
in place can be retrieved by issuing 'svn status object_recognition' and a list
of ready patches should be maintained in mods.txt

Adding a new patch
------------------
1. Create new patch
2. Update mods.txt
3. Remove file to patch
4. Call mods-link
