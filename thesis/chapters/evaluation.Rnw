\subsection{Maximum projection error in RANSAC}

Generally, the system relies on the size of the consensus set to be a strong
indicator for the goodness of an estimate. It was observed, though, that in one
experiment, the model was badly aligned, yet had strong support by many
inliers. The reason for the large consensus set is that the projection error is
a measure on the image plane, and matching keypoints are designated inliers as
long as they do not exceed the maximum projection error which is a circle on
the image plane. The problem can be traced back to the fact objects that are
far away from the camera merely degenerate to a point on the image plane. All
correspondences within the circle are designated inliers.
