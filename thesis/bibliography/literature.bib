@article{Agrawal2008,
abstract = {We explore the suitability of different feature detectors for the task of image registration, and in particular for visual odometry, using two criteria: stability (persistence across viewpoint change) and accuracy (consistent localization across viewpoint change). In addition to the now-standard SIFT, SURF, FAST, and Harris detectors, we intro- duce a suite of scale-invariant center-surround detectors (CenSurE) that outperform the other detectors, yet have better computational charac- teristics than other scale-space detectors, and are capable of real-time implementation.},

@article{Tuytelaars2007,
abstract = {In this survey, we give an overview of invariant interest point detectors, how they evolved over time, how they work, and what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. We begin with defining the properties of the ideal local feature detector. This is followed by an overview of the literature over the past four decades organized in different categories of feature extraction methods. We then provide a more detailed analysis of a selection of methods which had a particularly significant impact on the research field. We conclude with a summary and promising future research directions.},

@article{Lowe1999,
abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

abstract = {Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing classifiers and visualizing their performance. ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.},

@article{Rosten2006,
abstract = {Where feature points are used in real-time frame-rate applications, a high-speed feature detector is necessary. Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7\% of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120\%) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300\%) can operate at full frame rate.},

@article{Calonder2010,
abstract = {We propose to use binary strings as an efficient feature point descriptor, which we call BRIEF.We show that it is highly discriminative even when using relatively few bits and can be computed using simple intensity difference tests. Furthermore, the descriptor similarity can be evaluated using the Hamming distance, which is very efficient to com- pute, instead of the L2 norm as is usually done. As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match.We compare it against SURF and U-SURF on standard benchmarks and show that it yields a similar or better recognition performance, while running in a fraction of the time required by either.},

abstract = {We add to a manipulators capabilities a new primitive motion which we term a push-grasp. While significant progress has been made in robotic grasping of objects and geometric path planning for manipulation, such work treats the world and the object being grasped as immovable, often declaring failure when simple motions of the object could produce success. We analyze the mechanics of push-grasping and present a quasi-static tool that can be used both for analysis and simulation.We utilize this analysis to derive a fast, feasible motion planning algorithm that produces stable push- grasp plans for dexterous hands in the presence of object pose uncertainty and high clutter. We demonstrate our algorithm extensively in simulation and on HERB, a personal robotics platform developed at Intel Labs Pittsburgh.},
