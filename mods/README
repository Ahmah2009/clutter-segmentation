The files in this directories are all files that have been adapted to our
needs, or were being patched. The following lists the SVN revisions from which
the adaptations have been derived.

item                revision

All modified files can be hardlinked using the script mods-link, thus after
linking, changes to patches in this repository will be automatically reflected
in their respective source repo (and the other way round). A list of patches
in place can be retrieved by issuing 'svn status object_recognition' and a list
of ready patches should be maintained in mods.txt

Adding a new patch
------------------
1. Create new patch
2. Update mods.txt
3. Remove file to patch
4. Call mods-link
